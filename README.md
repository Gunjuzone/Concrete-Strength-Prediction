# Concrete-Strength-Prediction
In this project, Support Vector Machine was used to create a predictive model for estimating the compressive strength of concrete. The data was preprocessed, the model was trained, and its performance was evaluated. The results, with acceptable MAE and RMSE, demonstrate the potential for data-driven solutions in improving the accuracy and efficiency of compressive strength of concrete.
